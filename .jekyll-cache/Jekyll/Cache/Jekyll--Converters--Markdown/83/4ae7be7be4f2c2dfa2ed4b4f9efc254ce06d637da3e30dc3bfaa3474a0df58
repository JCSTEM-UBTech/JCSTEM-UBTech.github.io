    JC STEM Lab @ HKU is founded in 2022. Our research focuses on endowing machines with the capability to perceive, understand, reconstruct, and interact with the visual world, with the following focuses:
    <ul> 
      <li>label-efficient, transferrable and lifelong machine learning algorithms that are generalizable to various visual tasks</li>
      <li>efficient compression techniques for visual data transmission</li>
      <li>effective techniques for perceiving, interpreting and reasoning multi-modal (including vision, language, etc.) knowledge</li>
      <li>learnable 3D models for extracting 3D semantics, inferring geometrical relationships, and rendering high-fidelity geometrical structures</li>
      <li>deeply learned generative models for synthesizing or translating between multi-modal data.</li>
    </ul>
