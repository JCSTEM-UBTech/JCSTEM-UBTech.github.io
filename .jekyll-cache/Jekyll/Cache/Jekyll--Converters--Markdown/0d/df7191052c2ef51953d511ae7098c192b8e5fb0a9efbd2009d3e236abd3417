I"X<p>This is the homepage of the JC STEM Lab at the University of Hong Kong. We built this website ourselves in 2023 with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Our website is user-friendly, highly modularized and could be personalized very quickly! If youâ€™d like to, you can build your own academic website for free based on our framework. The code of our website is available on <a href="https://github.com/jcstem/jcstem.github.io">Github</a>.
